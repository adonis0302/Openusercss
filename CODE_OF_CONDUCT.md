# OpenUserCSS Code of Conduct

OpenUserCSS is an open source project about customising your online experience
with CSS themes to empower ourselves and others to be able to use websites in
the way we wish.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Aggressive and passive-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism,
providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred
to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else,
feigning surprise at someone's lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic,
or subtle prejudice.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

We will remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct. We
may ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for violating this code,
when appropriate.

Because the need for confidentiality for all parties involved in an enforcement
action outweighs the goals of openness, limited information will be shared with
the OpenUserCSS community regarding enforcement actions that have taken place.

## Making a report

If you are unable to resolve the issue, or are uncomfortable doing so, you
should contact the project lead at decentm+conduct@decentm.com. All
reports will be treated confidentially, impartially and consistently. 

Please be aware that electronic reports may not be seen immediately.  
When making a report, the following information is useful, but not required:  

* Who violated this Code of Conduct?
* Where and when did the violation occurred?
* What happened?
* Who may have witnessed the violation?
* Who are you?

In order for you to be able to express your issue as accurately as possible, you
don't have to copy this list above. Feel free to explain your issue in your own
words, or copy the list if you wish.
