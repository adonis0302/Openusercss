## Submitting issues  
When submitting an issue/bug, take a look at [the issue list](https://github.com/OpenUserCSS/openusercss.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if your issue was already posted.  
I also recommend reading [this great writeup](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) by Simon Tatham, the author of PuTTY and [a bunch of other free software](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/)!

## Setting up your development environment  
1. Install the git command line client using your package manager, or from ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
1. Install NodeJS using your package manager, or from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (use either the latest, or the latest LTS version)
1. Install yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
1. Fork the repository into your account
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/openusercss.org.git .`
1. Type `yarn` to install all the required dependencies into the node_modules directory
1. (optinally) Add `./node_modules/.bin` into your $PATH, as all required binaries are there
1. Type `npm run watch` to start the development server with live reload
1. Hack away!  

## Running tests
There are three types of tests you can run:
- Unit tests - `npm run test:unit`/`yarn run test:unit`
- API tests - `npm run test:api`/`yarn run test:api`
- End-to-end tests - `npm run test:e2e`/`yarn run test:e2e`

When you submit the Pull Request, an automated system will run these tests and validate the PR. Running the rest of the tests is optional, but I recommend doing it before pushing anyway.

## Committing  
This project follows the `standard` commit message convention. For example:  
`feat(client): Display short revision id + branch in footer`  

If you don't want to type this format manually, you can use `npm run c` or `git-cz` to launch Commitizen that creates the format for you.  

When you make a commit, the pre-commit hook will lint your code, then run unit tests. Please make sure that you stash changes you haven't added to your commit, so that tests only run on code you're about to commit.
